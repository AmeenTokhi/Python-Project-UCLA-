Graph-Based Analysis of Penguin Dataset
Python, NetworkX, Pandas, Matplotlib

Created a graph-based data analysis tool using the Palmer Penguins dataset to model relationships between individual penguins based on shared characteristics or calculated similarities.

Built a weighted graph where nodes represent individual penguins and edges reflect a computed similarity score or distance metric.

Implemented algorithms like Breadth-First Search and Dijkstra's Algorithm to explore connections and identify optimal paths between penguins in the graph.

Visualized the graph structure using NetworkX and Matplotlib to highlight clusters and relational patterns among the penguins.

Demonstrated data processing, graph theory, and visualization skills through the integration of file I/O, data transformation, and algorithmic analysis.
